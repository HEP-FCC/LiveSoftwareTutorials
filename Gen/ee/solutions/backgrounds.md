# FCC-ee: Side task - generating the two largest backgrounds

The two largest Standard Model backgrounds to the mumuH signal are
e+e- -> WW and e+e- -> ZZ (diboson) production. Unlike the signal, these
don't need WHIZARD: Pythia8 can generate the hard process itself directly,
so this is a single Pythia8 step with no LHE file involved at all.

> **Note:** "Background" here means a different *physics process* (WW,
> ZZ) that can mimic the mumuH signal in the final state — not the
> beam-induced background familiar from FullSim studies, where machine-
> related backgrounds are overlaid onto a signal event at the
> simulation/reconstruction level. This tutorial's fast simulation chain
> doesn't include beam-induced background overlay at all.

Both reuse the signal's [`pythia_gen.py`](../pythia_gen.py) steering script
as-is — only the card and output filename change, and both are overridable
at the command line via `k4run`'s property overrides, so no file edits or
extra scripts are needed.

## WW

[`p8_ee_WW_ecm240.cmd`](p8_ee_WW_ecm240.cmd) turns on Pythia8's
own `WeakDoubleBoson:ffbar2WW` process at 240 GeV. Vertex/time smearing is
*not* done in the card (its own `Beams:allowVertexSpread` is left off);
`pythia_gen.py` applies the same Gaudi `GaussSmearVertex` tool and FCC-ee
IDEA values used for the signal instead — so smearing is consistent across
signal and backgrounds, rather than each card using its own values.

```bash
mkdir -p pythia_prod/WW && cd pythia_prod/WW
cp ../../solutions/p8_ee_WW_ecm240.cmd ../../pythia_gen.py .
k4run pythia_gen.py --Pythia8.PythiaInterface.pythiacard=p8_ee_WW_ecm240.cmd --IOSvc.Output=WW.root
```

This produces `WW.root`, an EDM4hep file with 10,000 W+W- events (real
`MCParticles`, e.g. semileptonic and hadronic W decays).

## ZZ

[`p8_ee_ZZ_ecm240.cmd`](p8_ee_ZZ_ecm240.cmd) is the same idea,
turning on `WeakDoubleBoson:ffbar2gmZgmZ` instead (the general neutral
electroweak diboson process — dominated by ZZ away from resonance, but
also including some gamma*/Z interference, hence the setting name):

```bash
mkdir -p pythia_prod/ZZ && cd pythia_prod/ZZ
cp ../../solutions/p8_ee_ZZ_ecm240.cmd ../../pythia_gen.py .
k4run pythia_gen.py --Pythia8.PythiaInterface.pythiacard=p8_ee_ZZ_ecm240.cmd --IOSvc.Output=ZZ.root
```

This produces `ZZ.root`, 10,000 ZZ events.
