# GenToAna Tutorial

FCC tutorial covering the full chain from event **Gen**eration through
Fast/Parametric **S**imulation (Delphes) to physics **Ana**lysis.

## Physics case

- **FCC-ee (full path):** e+e- -> mu mu H, H -> b b (WHIZARD + Pythia + Delphes IDEA card),
  analysed as Z(-> mu mu) H with a recoil-mass measurement and a H -> bb dijet mass.
- **FCC-hh (shorter, advanced transfer):** HH -> b b gamma gamma, reusing the FCC-ee
  material with less hand-holding, extending the physics objects covered to photons.

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HEP-FCC/GenToAna-Tutorial.git
cd GenToAna-Tutorial
```

(If you plan to submit fixes, fork the repo first and clone your fork
instead — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).)

## Structure

Each stage has its own top-level directory, split by collider, with a
solutions subfolder nested inside each collider's folder:

```
Gen/
  ee/            FCC-ee generation (WHIZARD -> HEPMC) and showering/decay (Pythia)
    solutions/   Worked solution, for offline use
  hh/            FCC-hh generation, starting from existing LHE
    solutions/
Sim/
  ee/            Delphes fast simulation, FCC-ee IDEA card
    solutions/
  hh/            Delphes fast simulation, FCC-hh card
    solutions/
Analysis/
  ee/            Stage1 (tagger + ntuple production) and Stage2 (selections/plots) for FCC-ee
    solutions/
  hh/            Stage1/Stage2 for FCC-hh
    solutions/
```

## Format

Students work through the markdown material directly in this repo
(VSCodium + extensions recommended for an all-in-one setup). Reference
solutions are also provided here for offline use.

## Branches

Specific schools/dates are tracked as branches or tags off `main`.
