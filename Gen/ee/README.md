# FCC-ee: Event generation

In this tutorial section, we illustrate how to generate events using the
Key4hep software stack and the FCC infrastructure built around it. MC
generator WHIZARD generates the hard process
$e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} H$, then Pythia8 showers,
hadronizes, and decays $H \rightarrow b \bar{b}$.

All commands below assume you start from the `Gen/ee` folder in the cloned
repository:

```bash
cd Gen/ee
```


## Environment setup

Everything needed (WHIZARD, Pythia8, the Key4hep/Gaudi tools) comes from the
[Key4hep](https://key4hep.github.io/key4hep-doc/) stack, which is a shared
software stack for generation, simulation, reconstruction, and analysis,
developed jointly across several future-collider projects (FCC, EIC, CEPC, ILC)
so they don't each maintain their own separate framework:

```bash
source /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh
```

This tutorial was tested in the `2026-04-08` release; to see all available
releases, use the plain `-r` parameter. This tutorial should also work with the
latest Key4hep stack.

> Notes:
> 1. Key4hep only supports Bash shell at the moment.
>
> 2. Apart from AlmaLinux 9, Key4hep stack also supports Ubuntu 24.04 and/or
>    26.04.
>
> 3. There is also `/cvmfs/fcc.cern.ch/sw/latest/setup.sh` setup script, which
>    provides the same Key4hep stack plus FCC-specific tools on top.

Key4hep bundles also other $e^{+}e^{-}$ capable event generators, not just
WHIZARD (a multi-particle matrix-element generator with automated NLO
capabilities) and Pythia8 (general-purpose parton shower, hadronization, and
decay generator, also capable of generating simple hard processes directly):
also Herwig 7 (general-purpose, with its own angular-ordered shower and cluster
hadronization model), Sherpa (general-purpose, known for automated multi-jet
merging), KKMCee (precision QED processes like Bhabha scattering and muon
pairs), MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (automated LO/NLO matrix-element generator across many
SM/BSM processes), and EvtGen (heavy-flavour hadron decays).

WHIZARD is used for this signal process because it computes the full $e^{+}e^{-}
\rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} H$ matrix element directly, with correct
multi-particle kinematics and spin correlations — other generators are better
suited to other processes (e.g. KKMCee for high-precision QED benchmarks).


## Step 1: WHIZARD - hard process

Check whether WHIZARD is available (and, via its path, that the right stack
release was sourced) and see its version:

```bash
which whizard
whizard --version
```

WHIZARD has no complete, supported interface to Pythia8 — only to the
legacy PYTHIA6 (see the
[WHIZARD manual](https://whizard.hepforge.org/manual.pdf)). So this step
only generates the hard process and writes it out in LHEf format;
showering, hadronization, and the $H \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ decay all happen
as an explicit separate step in Pythia8 (Step 2 below), rather than inside
WHIZARD itself.

The card, [`mumuH.sin`](mumuH.sin):

```
model = SM

# Center of mass energy
sqrts = 240 GeV

process mumuH = e1, E1 => e2, E2, H

beams = e1, E1 => gaussian => isr

# Beam energy spread (sigma, as a fraction of nominal beam energy) - not
# the same as beam-spot (vertex position) smearing, which is done later
# in Step 2's Pythia8 steering script.
gaussian_spread1 = 0.185%
gaussian_spread2 = 0.185%

?isr_handler      = true
$isr_handler_mode = "recoil"
isr_alpha         = 0.0072993
isr_mass          = 0.000511

# Configure the precision of matrix element integration
integrate (mumuH) { iterations = 10:100000:"gw", 5:200000:"" }
# Faster, lower-precision alternative for quick iteration/testing:
# integrate (mumuH) { iterations = 3:2000:"gw" }

# Generate a few more events than Step 2 actually reads (EvtMax = 10000
# there), to make sure it has enough events despite a few failures.
n_events = 10020

# Select which output format and its version to use
$lhef_version  = "3.0"
sample_format  = lhef
simulate (mumuH) { $sample = "mumuH" }
```

Run it in its own directory, as WHIZARD produces a lot of additional helper
files:

```bash
mkdir -p whizard_prod/mumuH && cd whizard_prod/mumuH
cp ../../mumuH.sin .
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 whizard mumuH.sin
```

This produces `mumuH.lhe`.

> Notes:
> 1. WHIZARD uses OpenMP and by default grabs all available cores on the
>    machine, which isn't friendly (or efficient) on shared/multi-user
>    nodes. `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` restricts it to a single thread; drop it
>    if you're on a machine you have exclusively to yourself and want the
>    integration step to finish faster.
> 2. WHIZARD also computes and prints the process cross-section during
>    the `integrate` step above — look for the `Integral[fb]`/`Error[fb]`
>    columns in the last combined row of the iteration table (also echoed
>    in the generated `mumuH.log` file). This is the cross-section for
>    the exact final state computed here
>    ($e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} H$), not the total $ZH$
>    production cross-section — it already includes the
>    $Z \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ branching fraction (~3.37%).

Two settings are deliberately left out rather than pinned explicitly,
relying on their WHIZARD defaults:

> Notes:
> 1. Higgs mass `mH` is not set, because WHIZARD's `SM` model already defaults
>    it to 125 GeV (`parameter mH = 125` in `SM.mdl`).
> 2. We do not keep beam and beam remnants particles, as writing the original
>    beam particles into the LHE record as extra entries breaks reading the
>    file into Pythia8 downstream, see
>    [WHIZARD manual](https://whizard.hepforge.org/manual.pdf).

## Step 2: Pythia8 - shower, hadronize, decay $H \rightarrow b \bar{b}$

Key4hep tooling doesn't provide Pythia8 as a bare standalone binary. Instead,
it wraps it into a [Gaudi](https://gitlab.cern.ch/gaudi/Gaudi) algorithm. Gaudi
is a component-based software framework (originally from LHCb/ATLAS, now widely
reused across HEP) that Key4hep is built on. Gaudi programs are assembled from
Algorithms, Tools, and Services wired together in a Python "steering
script"; `k4run` is Key4hep's command-line tool for running these scripts.

> Notes:
> 1. To get a list of all available commandline arguments which one can use to
>    adjust the steering script use:
>    ```bash
>    k4run <steering_script.py> --help
>    ```
> 2. To check that a steering script is valid without actually running the
>    job (parses the config, wires up components, but generates no events),
>    use:
>    ```bash
>    k4run <steering_script.py> --dry-run
>    ```
> 3. Gaudi components of the Key4hep ecosystem are spread through many
>    packages, here we primarily use the Gaudi components from
>    [`key4hep/k4Gen`](https://github.com/key4hep/k4Gen) (`PythiaInterface` +
>    `GenAlg`).

`PythiaInterface` reads a `.cmd` card, which can point at an external LHEf
file. The card that decays the Higgs into a $b\bar{b}$ pair, hadronizes, and
showers the event looks like this, [`mumuH_Hbb.cmd`](mumuH_Hbb.cmd):

```
! Reads the WHIZARD LHEf output from Step 1 and forces H -> b b. Vertex/time
! smearing is done separately in the Gaudi steering script
! (pythia_gen.py), not here.

! Read in the WHIZARD LHEf file
Beams:frameType = 4
Beams:LHEF = mumuH.lhe
Beams:setProductionScalesFromLHEF = off
Beams:allowMomentumSpread = off

! Keep initial state radiation off.
PartonLevel:ISR = off

Check:epTolErr = 1e-1
LesHouches:matchInOut = off

! Force H -> b b
25:onMode  = off
25:onIfAny = 5
```

The steering script [`pythia_gen.py`](pythia_gen.py) reads the card above. No
HepMC file is ever written to disk here: `GenAlg` writes the
Pythia8-generated event into Gaudi's in-memory transient event store and
`HepMCToEDMConverter` immediately reads it from there and converts it, within
the same job, to [EDM4hep](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep) — the only thing
actually written to disk is the final EDM4hep ROOT file.
EDM4hep is Key4hep's common Event Data Model: a shared, columnar data
format (built on [Podio](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio)) for storing
particles, hits, tracks, and reconstructed objects, so that generation,
simulation, reconstruction, and analysis stages can all read and write the
same files instead of each using their own custom format — it's what lets
[`Sim/ee`](../../Sim/ee/README.md) and `Analysis` consume this stage's output
directly.

A physical on-disk HepMC3 file could instead be produced via `k4Gen`'s
`HepMCFileWriter`, useful for debugging, but isn't used in this flow.
Beamspot vertex/time smearing is applied via the Gaudi `GaussSmearVertex` tool
wired into `GenAlg`, rather than Pythia8's own `Beams:allowVertexSpread`, which
would apply it a second time on top of this.

This script is also reused as-is for the WW/ZZ background samples in
[`solutions/backgrounds.md`](solutions/backgrounds.md) — the card and output filename are its
only two process-specific lines, both overridable at the command line
(shown below), so one script covers every sample generated this way:

```python
from Gaudi.Configuration import *
from GaudiKernel import SystemOfUnits as units
from edm4hep import labels as e4_labels

from Configurables import EventDataSvc
from k4FWCore import ApplicationMgr, IOSvc
ApplicationMgr().EvtSel = 'NONE'
ApplicationMgr().EvtMax = 10000
ApplicationMgr().ExtSvc += ["RndmGenSvc", EventDataSvc("EventDataSvc")]

# Writes the EventHeader collection (run/event number) expected by
# downstream tools.
from Configurables import EventHeaderCreator
eventHeaderCreator = EventHeaderCreator("eventHeaderCreator")
ApplicationMgr().TopAlg += [eventHeaderCreator]

# Beamspot vertex/time smearing (FCC-ee IDEA values), applied consistently
# to every sample generated with this script, via the Gaudi
# VertexSmearingTool rather than each Pythia8 card's own
# Beams:allowVertexSpread (which would either double-apply it, for cards
# that also set their own, or not apply it at all, for cards that don't).
from Configurables import GaussSmearVertex
smeartool = GaussSmearVertex()
smeartool.xVertexSigma = 5.96e-3 * units.mm
smeartool.yVertexSigma = 23.8e-6 * units.mm
smeartool.zVertexSigma = 0.397 * units.mm
smeartool.tVertexSigma = 10.89 * units.mm

# Default: the mumuH_Hbb signal card. Can be overridden via k4run's CLI
# property overrides, no file edits needed:
#   k4run pythia_gen.py --Pythia8.PythiaInterface.pythiacard=<card>.cmd
from Configurables import PythiaInterface
pythia8gentool = PythiaInterface()
pythia8gentool.pythiacard = "mumuH_Hbb.cmd"

from Configurables import GenAlg
pythia8gen = GenAlg("Pythia8")
pythia8gen.SignalProvider = pythia8gentool
pythia8gen.VertexSmearingTool = smeartool
pythia8gen.hepmc.Path = "hepmc"
# A small fraction of events (~1 in a few thousand) hit an unrecoverable
# Pythia8-level failure (e.g. energy-momentum conservation check) that
# retrying doesn't fix. Without raising this, Gaudi's default ErrorMax = 1
# means a single such event aborts the whole run. ErrorMax = 20 lets a
# handful be skipped instead.
pythia8gen.ErrorMax = 20
ApplicationMgr().TopAlg += [pythia8gen]

from Configurables import HepMCToEDMConverter
hepmc_converter = HepMCToEDMConverter()
hepmc_converter.hepmc.Path = "hepmc"
hepmc_converter.hepmcStatusList = []
hepmc_converter.GenParticles.Path = e4_labels.MCParticles
ApplicationMgr().TopAlg += [hepmc_converter]

iosvc = IOSvc()
# Output location can be overridden via:
#   k4run pythia_gen.py --IOSvc.Output=<output>.root

```

Set up a separate directory for this step, copy in the LHEf file produced
in Step 1 alongside the card and steering script, and run:

```bash
cd ../.. && mkdir -p pythia_prod/mumuH && cd pythia_prod/mumuH
cp ../../whizard_prod/mumuH/mumuH.lhe .
cp ../../mumuH_Hbb.cmd ../../pythia_gen.py .
k4run pythia_gen.py
```

This produces `mumuH_Hbb.root`, an EDM4hep file with the showered,
hadronized, $H \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ decayed event record, in an
`MCParticles` collection.

[`Sim/ee`](../../Sim/ee/README.md) consumes this file's `MCParticles` collection directly via
`k4SimDelphesAlg` from
[`key4hep/k4SimDelphes`](https://github.com/key4hep/k4SimDelphes), which takes
a generic `edm4hep::MCParticleCollection` as input, independent of how it was
produced.


## Side task: background samples

The two largest backgrounds to the mumuH signal, $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow WW$ and
$e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow ZZ$, can optionally be generated the same way as Step 2
— reusing `pythia_gen.py` with a different card, no WHIZARD step needed since
Pythia8 generates these hard processes itself. See
[`solutions/backgrounds.md`](solutions/backgrounds.md) for the walkthrough; the
cards themselves are also in the [`solutions/`](solutions) folder.

> **Note:** "Background" here means a different *physics process* (WW,
> ZZ) that can mimic the mumuH signal in the final state — not the
> beam-induced background familiar from FullSim studies, where machine-
> related backgrounds are overlaid onto a signal event at the
> simulation/reconstruction level. This tutorial's fast simulation chain
> doesn't include beam-induced background overlay at all.


## What's next

To graphically explore the relationships between the `MCParticles` in this
output (parent/child links, decay trees), see the
[eedE (EDM4hep Event Data Explorer) tutorial](https://hep-fcc.github.io/fcc-tutorials/main/2-gen-and-fastsim/2-4-eedE/README.html).

The showered, $H \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ decayed sample (`mumuH_Hbb.root`) is the
input to Delphes parametrized fast simulation with the FCC-ee IDEA card — see
[`Sim/ee`](../../Sim/ee/README.md).
